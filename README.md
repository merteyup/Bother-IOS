## Project Status
Project status is: _done.


## Room for Improvement
- I have practiced my UI/UX design skills.
- Also, authentication with Firebase and writing & reading from Firebase Database.
- Found neat Lottie animations and applied them on onboarding screen.

To do:
- Could be reading some of content from database. Since I don't have backend skills, and that's out of purpose I have left it uncompleted.


## Acknowledgements

- Many thanks to my course teachers and ex-colleague Arif Karahan.
